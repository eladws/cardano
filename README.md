# cardano
My Cardano node setup, happily shared for the greater good üçª

My goal was to try to make the process as simple as possible, and after a significant amount of time spent reading and experimenting, I mangaged to put everything in a <strong><em>single setup script</em></strong>, that will install everything you need and start a healthy and good-looking cardano node ü•≥ 

<h2>Full node deployment</h2>
For a full setup on a fresh server (e.g, an AWS EC2 instance), all you have to do is run the relevant setup script.

It will install all required packages, start a docker-compose application running a relay node alongside a prometheus instance, and setup several other required tasks such as a topolgy updater, etc.

Just log-in to your instance, copy the relevant setup script into the root folder (using <strong>scp</strong> or similar software) and run it.
Alternatively, you can `git clone` this repo into your server's home folder, and run the setup script from there.

You can choose `setup-official-image.sh` if you want to run the node using [IOHK's official docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/inputoutput/cardano-node), or `setup-custom-image.sh` if you want to run the node using a custom built docker image (you can of course use my image, and check out the `Dockerfile` I used to build it for more details). 


All you have to do is run the script. (<em>important:</em> the script is using `sudo` whenever required, so DO NOT run the script itself with `sudo` !)

If all is good, you should be able to see metrics updated on port 9090, and the topology file gets updated once per hour.

<h4>What is a topology updater?</h4>
In short, it is a process you have to run in order for your node to be known to other peers, and have a list of updated valid peers. This is highly recommended until Cardano will implement its peer-to-peer mechanism.

You can find a comprehensive discussion [here](https://forum.cardano.org/t/is-running-topology-updater-a-must/91494).

<h2>Just run the containers</h2>
Alternatively, you can build and run the containers yourself:

Build a cardano-node container, running the [latest pre-compiled executable](https://hydra.iohk.io/job/Cardano/cardano-node/cardano-node-linux/latest/)

```docker build -t [owner/repo] .```

Run the container

```docker volume create node-db```

```docker run -d -p 12798:12798 --mount source=node-db,target=/node-db [owner/repo]```

Run Prometheus container for monitoring

(Requires a prometheus.yml file containing the node's container address as a target)

```docker run -d -p 9090:9090 -v [path-to-prometheus.yml]:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml prom/prometheus```
