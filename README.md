# cardano
My Cardano node setup, happily shared for the greater good üçª

My goal was to try to make the process as simple as possible, and after a significant amount of time spent reading and experimenting, I mangaged to put everything in a <strong><em>single setup script</em></strong>, that will install everything you need and start a healthy and good-looking cardano node ü•≥ 

<h2>Full node deployment</h2>
For a full setup on a fresh server (e.g, an AWS EC2 instance), all you have to do is run the relevant <strong>setup.sh</strong> script.

It will install all required packages, start a <strong>docker-compose</strong> application running a relay node alongside a prometheus instance, and setup several other required tasks such as a topolgy updater, etc.

<h4>Deploying on a fresh Linux instance</h4>
To run on a fresh Linux instance, log-in to the instance, and copy the relevant setup script into the root folder (using <strong>scp</strong> or similar software).
Alternatively, you can `git clone` this repo into your server's home folder, and run the setup script from there.

You can choose `setup-official-image.sh` if you want to run the node using [IOHKs official docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/inputoutput/cardano-node), or `setup-custom-image.sh` if you want to run the node using a custom build docker image (you can of course use my image, and check out the `Dockerfile` for more details). 


Give the script run permissions, and execute it with sudo.

If all is good, you should be able to see metrics updated on port 9090, and the topology file gets updated once per hour.

<h4>What is a topology updater?</h4>
In short, it is a process you have to run in order for your node to be known to other peers, and have a list of updated valid peers. This is highly recommended until Cardano will implement its peer-to-peer mechanism.

You can find a comprehensive discussion [here](https://forum.cardano.org/t/is-running-topology-updater-a-must/91494).

<h2>Just run the containers</h2>
Alternatively, you can build and run the containers yourself:

Build a cardano-node container, running the [latest pre-compiled executable](https://hydra.iohk.io/job/Cardano/cardano-node/cardano-node-linux/latest/)

```docker build -t [owner/repo] .```

Run the container

```docker volume create node-db```

```docker run -d -p 12798:12798 --mount source=node-db,target=/node-db [owner/repo]```

Run Prometheus container for monitoring

(Requires a prometheus.yml file containing the node's container address as a target)

```docker run -d -p 9090:9090 -v [path-to-prometheus.yml]:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml prom/prometheus```
